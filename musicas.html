        Candy in the cup, gotta get paid<br>
        King in the streets<br>
        Young -- made<br>
        Sprayin at the crowd, take it to the grave<br>

        -- getting rich ready take you to war<br>
        Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad<br>
        Do you somethin nasty, roll you in a gar<br>
        I get you a brand new rolly tomorrow<br>
        I put that brand new rolly on your arm<br>
        Aint movin slow but I'm still on oil<br>
        Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost<br>
        Cuban links all the way up to your jaw<br>
        Step up the swag when I step on a broad<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Two dollar half, ooh that's the cheapest one<br>
        Stackin these hundreds up, like coupons<br>
        Told you from the beginning, upper echelon<br>
        And I get to stackin up, I'm untouchable<br>
        I get to represent, money multiple<br>
        Im at the top of the charts unapproachable<br>
        Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor<br>
        Tic tac toe, killing all the vultures<br>
        Sellin elbows, --do yoga<br>
        I deserve awards, serving these boulders<br>
        Hundred grand large when I shop that's the total<br>
        Fill up the garage, --I'm a mogul<br>
        Ain't no façadin, ain't no fugazi<br>
        I drop it off, I get paid<br>
        Drop Top royce, I'm going crazy<br>
        I push off, smoking on haze<br>
        Not tryna floss, Cartier shades<br>
        Candy in the cup, gotta get paid<br>
        King in the streets<br>
        Young -- made<br>
        Sprayin at the crowd, take it to the grave<br>
        Ain't havin problems I'm sippin the bar<br>
        Shout out to dallas my --is a star<br>

        Cuban links all the way up to your jaw<br>
        Step up the swag when I step on a broad<br>
        (Dark knight feeling, die or be a hero,<br>
        Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain)<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon as you up these --s wanna bring you down<br>
        The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown<br>
        I aint gotta cape so I can't save you now<br>
        Rather see you drown (yeah)<br>
        And the world keep spinnin (yeah)<br>
        Like I'm the only one in it (am I the only one?)<br>
        Why?<br>
        They don't wanna see you winnin<br>
        So who's really the villain? (yeah)<br>

    <p>
        G5 the flight, man, I'm way in the sky <br>
        She finna tell me, "No way" and it's cap <br>
        Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky <br>
        G5 the flight, a nigga way in the sky <br>
        G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here (man, I'm way outta here)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me <br>
        I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky <br>
        Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes <br>
        Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie <br>
        Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy <br>
        Walkin' on shit, turn it up and not gas it <br>
        Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it <br>
        Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it <br>
        Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good <br>
        Park a two mil' in the middle of my hood <br>
        Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewer <br>
        Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good <br>
        Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same <br>
        They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain <br>
        Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit <br>
        Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada <br>
        Bro get this money like it's my religion <br>
        It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas <br>
        That try to compare whatever I did <br>
        Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig <br>
        I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid <br>
        I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib <br>
        I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's <br>
        Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in <br>
        I keep and go fully, no matter where I'm in <br>
        Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean <br>
        You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win <br>
        Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition <br>
        Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist <br>
        I'm never sober, I'm thinkin' 'bout quittin' <br>
        I pop the E, I can feel when it kick <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me <br>
        I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        Count up some millions and take some more drugs <br>
        Been stuck in my memory, they wasn't showin' love <br>
        Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub <br>
        I started this wave, and ain't usin' a brush <br>
        Stopped taking molly, now I'm back on the E <br>
        Flyin' commercial, you ain't high as me <br>
        Driving the spaceship, the one with the wings <br>
        Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key <br>
        Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back <br>
        Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack <br>
        After I hit your bitch, givin' her back <br>
        Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap <br>
        Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt <br>
        Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular cat <br>
        Took a few 'shrooms, I forget where I'm at <br>
        Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>
        Early in the morning, late at night (I will wait for you) <br>
        It don't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you) <br>
        Presidential Rollie already on the way (higher, sayin', "Aye, yi, yi, yi") <br>
        Whenever I find time, it's okay (ayy) <br>
        (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob) <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        You pray for my demons, girl, I got you <br>
        Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable <br>
        I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come <br>
        She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going <br>
        I been in the field like the children of the corn <br>
    </p>

    <p> <br>
        I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone <br>
        Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone <br>
        Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (world was ending) <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Travel around the world (would you cry, or would you try to get me?) <br>
        Over the phone, dropping tears (tell me now, I want you be clear, yeah) <br>
        I get more vulnerable when I do drugs (tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah) <br>
        When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you) <br>
        When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you) <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you) <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you) <br>
    </p>

    <p> <br>
        Yeah, I been trapping 'round the world <br>
        I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feeling <br>
        I got a career that takes my time away from women <br>
        I cannot convince you that I love you for a living (will wait for you, for you) <br>
        I be on your line, feelings flowing like a river <br>
        You be texting back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you) <br>
        Message say "Delivered" (I will wait for you), but I know that you 'on't get it <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you) <br>
        Made me shake his hand when y'all been fucking for a minute (I will wait for you, for you) <br>
        Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you) <br>
        Supposed to be your dawg, but you done put me in a kennel <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barking over dinner <br>
        I was fucking with you when you had the tiny Presidential <br>
        You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental <br>
        Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential <br>
        Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone <br>
        Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone <br>
